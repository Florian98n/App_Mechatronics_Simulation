# App_Mechatronics_Simulation

The repository stores an application who was suppose to simulate mechatronic processes.
Everything is made in python using tkinter library.
Features implemented:
- drop down list with all components (Pneumatics, Hydraulics, Electronics)
- search button
- the objects can be inserted only inside on the defined workspace
- option to resize the workspace (using "Workspace size" window accessible from menu "Window")
- right click in order to do operation on objects
- automate asignation of unic index for the objects from the same type
- option to make an object moveble (right-click and "Move")
- option to delete an object (right-click and "Delete")
- option to set the parameters of an objects (ex: Pneumatics->Active->Valve 5/3, right click and click on name)
- zoom in and zoom out buttons (4 views)
- buttons who control the simulation (Start, Pause, Stop)
- when the Start button from simulation is pressed the valves who have buttons and spring shall work corectly (it work only for "Valve 5/3" object)
